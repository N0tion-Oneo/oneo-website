description: Generate a React component with TypeScript
---

I need to create a new React component.

Please ask me for:
1. Component name (PascalCase, e.g., "JobCard", "ProfileForm")
2. Component type (presentational, form, layout, page)
3. Props it should accept
4. State it needs to manage (if any)
5. API calls it makes (if any)

Then generate:
- Component file (`src/components/<Name>/<Name>.tsx` or `src/pages/<Name>.tsx`)
- TypeScript interface for props
- Tailwind CSS styling using Oneo brand colors
- Any necessary hooks (useState, useEffect, custom hooks)

Follow the patterns in `.claude/instructions.md` and use functional components with hooks.
