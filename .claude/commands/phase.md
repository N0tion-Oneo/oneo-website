description: Start a new development phase from the V1 Plan
---

I want to start implementing a specific phase from the development plan.

Please:
1. Read the `Docs/V1 Plan` file
2. Show me the list of phases with their goals
3. Ask me which phase I want to work on
4. Once I select a phase, create a detailed todo list with all tasks for that phase
5. Begin with the first task

Remember to mark tasks as completed as we progress through the phase.
