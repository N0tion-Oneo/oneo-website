description: Generate test cases for backend or frontend
---

I need to write tests for existing code.

Please ask me:
1. What are we testing? (model, API endpoint, React component, utility function)
2. File path to the code being tested
3. What scenarios should be covered?

Then generate appropriate tests:
- **Backend**: pytest test cases in `tests.py`
  - Test model creation and validation
  - Test API endpoints (success and error cases)
  - Test permissions
  - Test serializers
- **Frontend**: Component tests or hook tests
  - Test component rendering
  - Test user interactions
  - Test API integration
  - Test edge cases

Include setup, assertions, and cleanup as needed.
