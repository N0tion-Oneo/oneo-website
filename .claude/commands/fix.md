description: Debug and fix an error or issue
---

I'm encountering an error or issue and need help fixing it.

Please ask me for:
1. What's the error message or unexpected behavior?
2. Where is it happening? (backend, frontend, specific file)
3. What were you doing when it occurred?
4. Any relevant code snippets or stack traces?

Then:
1. Analyze the error
2. Identify the root cause
3. Propose a solution
4. Implement the fix
5. Suggest how to prevent similar issues

If it's a common issue, reference best practices from `.claude/instructions.md`.
